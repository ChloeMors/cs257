NAME
     python3 books.py -- search books list

SYNOPSIS
     books.py [[-t [titleString]] [-s ['title' | 'year']]
     books.py [-a [authorString]] | [-y [yearString]]
     books.py [-h] 
     books.py [-v]

DESCRIPTION
     In its first form, books.py will search through a books database by flag
     (title, author, or year) for searchString, or applicable years for -y,
     and returns a list of books. Only a single search (-t, -a, -y) flag can 
     be used at a time. -s indicates a sorting override, to use with -t.

     In its second and third forms, users can view help or version statements. 

     The following options are available:



     -t --title      Search database for titles containing searchString
	     (case-insensitive), returning list of books sorted by title.
	     Search strings including space characters need to be surrounded
             By quotations 

     -a --author     Search database for authors containing searchString
	     (case-insensitive), returning list of books sorted by surname,
	     ties broken by given name. Search strings including space 
	     characters need to be surrounded by quotations 

     -y --year     Search database for books published within year range,
	     inclusive, returning list of books sorted by publication year.
	     range should be two years separated by a hyphen with spaces
	     (e.g. "1900 - 1901") or one year ("1900") or a year with a 
	     hyphen to indicate an unbounded search ("1900 -" or "- 1900"). 
	     The user need to include quotations around the year range. 
	     Please note, if you add a space before or after a hyphen when 
	     there's not a number on the other side (" - 1999") the program 
	     will fail. 

     -s --sort	  Override sorting list by alternative criteria. Options are 
	     title or year


     -h --help      Print usage statement

     -v --version     Print version



     It is an error for improper inputs, such as "abc" with the -y flag. 

     It is an error if no string follows -s.

     Example code: python3 books.py -t "the" -s year
                   python3 books.py -a "e"
                   python3 books.py -y "- 2010"
