DESCRIPTION
     In its first form, books.py will search through a books database by flag
     (title, author, or year) for searchString, or applicable years for -y,
     and returns a list of books. Flags can be used in any order, and any 
     combination. When used in combination, order is determined by primary flag.

     The following options are available:

	     (case-insensitive), returning list of books sorted by title. 

     -a --author     Search database for authors containing searchString
	     (case-insensitive), returning list of books sorted by surname,
	     ties broken by given name.  

     -y --year     Search database for books published within year range,
	     inclusive, returning list of books sorted by publication year.
	     range should be two years separated by a hyphen (e.g. "1900-1901")
	     or one year ("1900").
